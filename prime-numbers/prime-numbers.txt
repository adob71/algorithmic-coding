* The purpose of the script is to return all prime numbers up to a given number
* On repeat runs, the script should indicate whether a number has been seen before

Example expected output when first run up to 10, and then called a second time up to 20

-----------------------
# call script up to 10
2 3 5 7
# call script up to 20
2* 3* 5* 7* 11 13 17 19
